# COURSE OUTLINE
### 1. Course name and number:
Applied Modern Algebra, Math 302.

### 2. Credits:
3, 3 hours lecture.

### 3. Course Instructor:
A lecturer of Department of Applied Mathematics.

### 4. Textbook:
  * Edward R. Scheinerman, _Mathamatics: A Discrete Introduction_, 3ed, 2012, 506p (chapter 4 section 23; chap 5 sec 27, 28; chap 7, 8).
  * Ralph P. Grimaldi, _Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics - An Applied Introduction_, 5ed, 2004, 992p (chap 9, 10, 16).
  * Ralph P. Grimaldi, _Discrete and Combinatorial Mathematics - Instructor's Solutions Manual_, 5ed, 2004, 465p.

### 5. Specific course information:
  * Catalog Description: Languages, generating functions, recurrence relations, optimization, rings, groups, coding theory, and Polya theory.
  * Prerequisites: Math 301: Discrete Mathematics (Minimum grade: C).
  * Designation: Required.

### 6. Specific goals for the course outcomes:
  * **Course Outcomes:** Upon course completion the student should be able to demonstrate:
    + perform addition and subtraction of sequences and abstract power series.
    + use basic ordinary and exponential generating functions to solve counting problems.
    + write recurrence relations to model counting problems, and solve linear recurrence relations.
    + define the four basic properties of an abstract group, determine whether a set and operation satisfy these properties, and use them to prove other facts about groups.
    + perform calculations using modular arithmetic, including finding multiplicative inverses and solving simultaneous linear equations.
    + understand the theoretical basis for public key encryption, and apply (simplified versions of) both Rabin's method and RSA algorithms.
    + apply Polya enumeration methods to examples involving symmetry groups.

  * **Relationship between Course Outcomes and Program Outcomes**
    + The ABET/CAC criteria for computer science require the study of discrete mathematics. The BSCS program requires Math 301 and 302 to satisfy this expectation.
    + All eight course outcomes contribute to program outcomes (a) and (j).

### 7. List of Leture Topics:
  * Counting.
  * Introductory Number Theory.
  * Abstract Algebra.
